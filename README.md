# Glucose Direct App

**Warning, the project is strictly for my personal use and is highly experimental.**

App programmed in Swift/SwiftUI for using Libre 1/2 blood glucose sensors. I try to keep the code as readable and understandable as possible so that as many people as possible can understand how this part of diabetes management works.

## Current features
- Libre 2 EU support (without transmitter)
- Libre 1 support with transmitter (supported transmitter bubble)
- Add manual bgm values
- Manage bgm/cgm values
- Units mg/dL or mmol/L
- Nightscout upload
- FreeAPS X support (with Shared App Groups)
- Calendar export
- Glucose badge
- Glucose chart
- Glucose trend arrow
- Glucose change per minute
- Factory calibration
- Custom calibration
- Lifetime details
- Transmitter details
- Sensor details
- Glucose alert for lows and highs
- Connection lost alert
- Missed readings alert
- Sensor expiring alert
- Snooze for glucose alerts
